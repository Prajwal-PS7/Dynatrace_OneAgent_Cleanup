## 🛠️ Usage

### 1. Prepare `workers.txt`
List each worker node (hostname/IP) on a new line:

> 192.168.1.10 <br> 192.168.1.11

🔒 Make sure passwordless SSH or SSH key access is enabled for all nodes.

### 2. Run the script
```
chmod +x cleanup.sh
```
```
./cleanup.sh
```

📌 Target Cleanup Path <br>
The script clears the following directory on each node:

> /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/dynatrace_oneagent_storage/_data/

You can update the path in the `TARGET_DIRECTORY` variable.

⚠️ Disclaimer
- Use this script in production with caution.
